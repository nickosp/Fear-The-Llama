Hudles:

Hurdles, they're were quite a few, The main one was I ran out of time and wasn't able to add a llama image in the middle like i wanted to. I was able to add it but it didn't look right on the mobile version and I wanted to make sure everything as was working 100% before I spent a bunch of time on it. Another major was I had to work all day saturday/sunday and it made me have to put in endless hours on monday, but it turned out well I think. Getting the sounds to play was actually easy, but it took me a while to figure out, more of a not used to using IOS than a coding problem though.
